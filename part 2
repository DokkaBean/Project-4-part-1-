/*
There are three conditions we have to keep in mind while generating ordinals
1, 2, 3 are treated differently i.e numbers ending with 1, 2, 3 are treated differently they end 'st', 'nd', 'rd' respectively

11,22,33 ... the teens are treated differently, so numbers ending with 11,22, 44,55, 66 will have 'th'

remaining all the numbers will have 'th' in the end.


To apply the above conditions we bring the numbers within 0 to 100 range i.e mod 100 we perform
